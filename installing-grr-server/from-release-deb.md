# Installing from a release server deb (recommended)

This is the recommended way of installing the GRR server components. GRR server
debs are built for Ubuntu Xenial. They may install on Debian or other Ubuntu
versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

To start, download the latest server deb from
<https://github.com/google/grr/releases>, e.g:

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.grr-response.com/grr-server___GRR_DEB_VERSION___amd64.deb
```

Install the server deb, along with its dependencies, like below:

```
sudo apt install -y ./grr-server___GRR_DEB_VERSION___amd64.deb
```

The installer will prompt for a few pieces of information to get things set up.
After successful installation, the `grr-server` service should be running:

```bash
root@grruser-xenial:/home/grruser# systemctl status grr-server
‚óè grr-server.service - GRR Service

```

In addition, administrative commands for GRR, e.g `grr_console` and
`grr_config_updater` should be available in your PATH.
